"""
Script to download radar data from an mmWave radar's DSP board via SCP.

This script connects to the DSP board over SSH and transfers the specified radar
data files to a local directory using `download_files.py` from `radar_utility.py`.

Usage:
    - Modify `cases` to specify the capture IDs to download.
    - Ensure SCP is configured with the necessary SSH access.

Dependencies:
    - `radar_utility.py` (must contain the `download_files` function).
    - `time` (standard Python library).

Attributes:
    cases (list): List of radar capture IDs to download.
    remote_files (list): List of radar data files to transfer.

    Downloads radar data for a specific capture case.

    Steps:
    
    1. Constructs the remote and local file paths based on `capture_id`.
    2. Calls `download_files()` to transfer data via SCP.
    3. Prints timing information for performance tracking.

    Parameters:
        capture_id (int): Unique identifier for the radar data capture.

    Example:
        >>> capture_id = 400
        >>> # This will download the data files for the given capture ID.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the SCP transfer fails.
